# 📖 Movies/Series Contents

## 1. [MONOGATARI SERIES](https://bakemonogatari.fandom.com/wiki/Monogatari_Series_Timeline_and_Watch_Guide) <sup><sub>(by Nisio Isin)</sub></sup> ![MONOGATARI SERIES](https://github.com/Jaime223646/app-dev/blob/main/assets/MONOGATARI%20SERIES.png)
>   *Monogatari goes out of its way to show how even the smallest things can cause life-changing repercussions. It's unfulfilled, self-hating people who will break under pressure.*

## 2. [DEATH NOTE](https://deathnote.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Note_Wiki) <sup><sub>(by Tsugumi Ohba)</sub></sup> ![DEATH NOTE](https://github.com/Jaime223646/app-dev/blob/main/assets/DEATH%20NOTE.png)
>   *A cult classic, Death Note garnered enough attention to get a disastrous manga adaptation as well. Death Note is so realistic. Every single character is psychologically developed in a perfect way. Their behaviour is human to the point they could easily fit into "regular" world.*

## 3. [BUNGO STRAY DOGS](https://bungostraydogs.fandom.com/wiki/Bungo_Stray_Dogs_Wiki) <sup><sub>(by Sango Harukawa)</sub></sup> ![BUNGO STRAY DOGS](https://github.com/Jaime223646/app-dev/blob/main/assets/BUNGO%20STRAY%20DOGS.png)
>   *We've all heard the famous phrase "I'd rather be a Jack of all trades than a king of one", but what happens when you try to be at Jack of too many trades? Well, that's where you get a show like Bunguo Stray Dogs.*

## 4. [STEINS GATE](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Steins;Gate_Wiki) <sup><sub>(by Chiyomaru Shikura)</sub></sup> ![STEINS GATE](https://github.com/Jaime223646/app-dev/blob/main/assets/STEINS%20GATE.png)
>   *The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off.*

## 5. [AJIN](https://ajin.fandom.com/wiki/Kei_Nagai) <sup><sub>(by Gamon Sakurai)</sub></sup> ![AJIN](https://github.com/Jaime223646/app-dev/blob/main/assets/AJIN.png)
>   *Ajin manga is truly a hidden gem. It's well-paced, enjoyable, and relatively original. Ajin is surely not a story for everyone. But for those with suitable leaning it may very well come nothing short of a masterpiece.*
